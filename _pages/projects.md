# 🧪 Selected Projects

### 🧾 Master’s Thesis – Tumor Mutation Tree Clustering 
Developed a neural-network-free pipeline to cluster tumor mutation trees in cancer genomics using machine learning and kernel-based graph representations.  
Achieved **competing results** with a neural network–based baseline, including a **increased silhouette score** and **significantly reduced runtime**.

*GitHub repository coming soon.*

### 🧬 FOXC2 RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis  
Analyzed RNA-seq data from FOXC2-knockout mouse melanoma cells to investigate transcriptomic changes related to immune evasion and interferon signaling.  
Pipeline includes quality control, pseudoalignment with Kallisto, differential expression (limma/voom), and GO enrichment (clusterProfiler).

- **Nonlinear & Oscillatory Dynamics:**  
  Modeled substrate inhibition, washout, vector fields, and delay effects in bioprocess systems.  
  [🔗 Nonlinear Dynamics Project](https://github.com/Tamilaam/bioprocess-modeling-course-projects/blob/main/Bioreactor_Nonlinear_Dynamics.ipynb)

- **Finite-Element Simulation of Diffusion-Reaction:**  
  Simulated substrate diffusion and Monod-based enzymatic consumption inside a spherical immobilized-cell bead using FEM (FEniCS).  
  Included parameter sweeps, nonlinear solver setup, and radial concentration gradients.

### 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

- **DNA Contour Length Analysis with ML:**  
  Estimated DNA rise-per-residue (rpr) from AFM measurements using both regression and a KNN classifier to distinguish DNA types.
