## 🧪 Selected Projects

### 🧬 Mapping Single-Cell Transcriptomic Patterns with Machine Learning (ongoing)

I’m currently developing a reproducible analysis pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq data from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The goal is to process omics data from public sources, apply machine learning to classify cell states, and uncover network-level relationships between genes involved in disease progression. The pipeline is implemented in Python using **Scanpy, XGBoost, and Nextflow**, and results are structured into a **SQL database** for further exploration and integration.


*GitHub repository coming soon.*

### 🧾 Master’s Thesis – Tumor Mutation Tree Clustering 

Developed a machine learning pipeline for clustering tumor mutation trees using structural features extracted through graph kernels. Applied the method to diverse datasets, including a **real-world AML cohort** (123 trees), a **pan-cancer tree collection** spanning six cancer types, and a **synthetic dataset** designed with known structural patterns. By replacing neural network embeddings with kernel-derived cosine similarities, the pipeline achieved **comparable or better clustering performance** while **reducing runtime significantly**. Key evaluation results include **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI = 0.62)**, **Mantel correlation (r = 0.71)**, and a **+728% improvement in Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) score** over baseline. This lightweight, interpretable approach offers a practical alternative for analyzing biological graph data with minimal computational cost.
