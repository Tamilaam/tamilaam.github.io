Hello! I'm **Tamila**, a computational biologist and current bioinformatics intern at the **Algorithmic Bioinformatics Lab, Heinrich Heine University D√ºsseldorf**.  

I work at the intersection of **computer science, data science, and biology**, where I apply **algorithms and machine learning** to extract meaningful insights from complex biological phenomena.  

My current focus is on **cancer genomics**, with a particular interest in **tumor mutation and evolutionary patterns**.
