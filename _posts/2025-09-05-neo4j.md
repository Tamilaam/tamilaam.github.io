*Oops... I did it again. Something cool with graphs!*  
*While doing data analysis for my thesis I kept thinking: what if there were a tool to explore mutation trees more easilyâ€”discovering relationships and events without opening graphs one by one?*  
*What if I could write a few lines of code and uncover patterns in my trees? That sounded like a fantasy but...*  
*Eureka! I found it. Neo4j is my new favorite. I load my trees and start exploringâ€”databases always fascinate me!*  
*But what I actually did was...*

I integrated tumor mutation trees from the AML dataset into a **Neo4j Aura graph database** to explore **biological relationships** between gene mutations across patient samples.  
I began by loading each tree as a set of connected mutation nodes, preserving the parentâ€“child structure of mutation events. To enrich the data, I linked an external CSV file containing clustering assignments (based on the pipeline I developed to cluster mutation trees) to the corresponding root nodes, enabling visualization of trees by cluster group.  
Using **Cypher queries**, I explored and visualized trees belonging to individual clusters, allowing for qualitative comparisons of topological patterns.  
Additionally, I developed queries to compute and visualize co-mutating gene pairs across samples, revealing frequently co-occurring mutations *(the magic!)*.  
Overall, this work shows how graph databases can support interactive and biologically meaningful analysis of tumor evolution patterns.

*Look at all the treesâ€¦*

*Letâ€™s look at a cluster in detailâ€¦*

*I found the most frequent co-occurring mutations! This is interesting information! ðŸ™‚*

*Or we can visualize all the mutations in a cluster and their proportions!*

This is a good reminder of the power of databases in data analysis, the time and energy they save, and the valuable insights we can extract.  
I look forward to doing more graph analysis with Neo4j in the future, especially in my new project on gene regulatory networks. *Can't wait to start it actually!*

*GitHub repository coming soonâ€¦*
